              The first “Afghans” were brought to South Australia in 1838, to
              assist in the early exploration of the interior of the country.
              Camels played an essential role in navigating through the harsh
              desert terrain that horses would struggle with. The goldfields of
              Western Australia were thriving in the late 1890s.
            </p>
            <p class="mainText">
              Usually found in the desert, the gold mines were difficult for
              horses to ride because of the soft sand and extreme heat. Camel
              imports from other nations persisted in order to construct the
              necessary infrastructure, including roads and train lines. The men
              who transported and cared for these camels were referred to as
              "Afghan Cameleers."

          Thousands of Afghani and Pakistani cameleers played an important role

        <p class="paraText">
          Since some of them weren't from Afghanistan, the name might be a
          little misleading. They also came from neighbouring countries such as
          Egypt, Iran, Turkey, India, and Pakistan. The majority of the
          cameleers were men and Muslims.

        <p class="paraText">
          The cameleers actively participated in the community, yet despite
          this, they faced prejudice because of their looks and religious
          beliefs. Tensions within the communities developed as a result of the
          government's increased restrictions and negative portrayal of them in
          the newspapers.
        </p>
        <p class="paraText">
          Many cameleers were affected by the Immigration Restriction Act (White
          Australia Policy), which was in effect from 1901 to 1958. After
          visiting family overseas, several of them were forced to take a
          dictation exam, which led to their denial of entry into Australia, and
          many were denied naturalization.

              Marree in 1883). The Afghan Cameleers were the founders Of Islam

              from Christian Europe and the Chinese immigration were mainly

              Within 2 decades large mosques in Adelaide and Perth were built by

              Afghan cameleers were on the road and although far from their

              travels a small group of fellow Afghans would carry a copy of the
              Quran and under a shade of a tree set the scene for prayer their
              prayer was a crucial part of their life since it made them
              steadfast in their faith prayer fostered unity amongst them these

          The camels and their cameleers helped carry supplies inland for the
          mining and sheep industries, aided the building of the Overland
          Telegraph Line, the Canning Stock Route, major fence lines and the
          Trans-Australia and Central Australian railways. They carried pipe
          sections for the Goldfields Water Supply, supplied goods to inland
          towns, mining camps, sheep and cattle stations and also Aboriginal
          communities. Wagons hauled by Camels moved wool from sheep stations to
          railheads, pulled scoops in the construction of dams, and helped with
          ploughing and other farm work.

          frequently got married. Neither party was permitted to use shared
          amenities like taverns or swimming pools after dark or to enter the
