# History Project

This is a History project developed with HTML, css and Javascript. The content are divided into seperate sections. excluding the first one, all other sections uses same css section classes which are repeatedly used. I have always been interested to read and learn about history that how people used to work and communicate where there was not advanced technology and equipments available. I choose this project to lighten and appreciate the efforts of camelee's in progrss of Australia by transportation when there were none means of transport available. Leaving their families back thousands of kilometers away and working in long deserts and without proper means of communication for almost a century. The commitment to the progress the country while being treated as lower class human is challenging for any race to work but they did not let that to stop their commitment to the country called Commonwealth of Australia.

# What went well?

For the scroll transition effects, I have to add transitions and two classes where the transition takes place. These classes will be triggered by intersection observer that checks if the section is on the screen, then triggers to active and inactive css class.

First and Foremost, I'm extremly satisfied with the scroll animations part. It was challenging aspect for me.
The color scheme I choose matches good with the pictures of cameelers.

# what could have been improved?

The design can be improved further as one page sites posted in canvas uses advance css.
More research could have been added to this assignment.
I wanted to add video animation but had some challenges finding a good one and also adjusting it with the theme of the page.
Nav bar could have been improved with menu.
Slider needs some improvements but I faced technical challenges in doing so.
