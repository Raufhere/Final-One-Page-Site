# Final-One-Page-Site

# History Project

This is a History project developed with HTML, css and Javascript. The content are divided into seperate sections. excluding the first one, all other sections uses same css section classes which are repeatedly used.

# What went well?

For the scroll transition effects, I have to add transitions and two classes where the transition takes place. These classes will be triggered by intersection observer that checks if the section is on the screen, then triggers to active and inactive css class.

First and Foremost, I'm extremly satisfied with the scroll animations part. It was challenging aspect for me.
The color scheme I choose matches good with the pictures of cameelers.

# what could have been improved?

The design can be improved further as one page sites posted in canvas uses advance css.
More research could have been added to this assignment.
I wanted to add video animation but had some challenges finding a good one and also adjusting it with the theme of the page.
Nav bar could have been improved with menu.
Slider needs some improvements but I faced technical challenges in doing so.
